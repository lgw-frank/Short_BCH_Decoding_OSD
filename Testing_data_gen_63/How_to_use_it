It describes total 8 testing data files are generated for the 8 SNRs distribued evenly between SNR=0.0-3.5dB, with the 100 batches of
mini-batch size 100 for the rightmost 3.5dB, and the data sizes for other SNR  points are proportional to the setting in line 51:
GL.set_map('portion_dis', '0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.6 0.75 0.75 1') #for generating testing data of various sizes
2) Click Run button of Main_test.py, it will end up with generated files stored in the designated directory.
